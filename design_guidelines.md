# Modern 3D Webinar Website Design Guidelines

## Design Approach
**Reference-Based Approach** - Drawing inspiration from modern SaaS platforms like Linear, Notion, and cutting-edge tech companies with emphasis on 3D elements and futuristic aesthetics.

## Core Design Elements

### Color Palette
**Primary Colors:**
- Brand Primary: 240 100% 65% (vibrant blue)
- Brand Secondary: 260 80% 55% (deep purple)

**Supporting Colors:**
- Background Dark: 220 15% 8% (rich dark navy)
- Background Light: 0 0% 98% (near white)
- Accent: 180 70% 50% (cyan for 3D highlights)
- Text Primary: 220 10% 95% (light gray)
- Text Secondary: 220 5% 70% (medium gray)

### Typography
- **Primary Font:** Inter (Google Fonts) - clean, modern sans-serif
- **Display Font:** Space Grotesk (Google Fonts) - for hero headlines
- **Hierarchy:** h1 (48px bold), h2 (36px semibold), h3 (24px medium), body (16px regular)

### Layout System
**Tailwind Spacing:** Consistent use of 4, 8, 12, 16, 24 units (p-4, m-8, gap-12, etc.)

### Component Library
- **Navigation:** Floating glass-morphism header with backdrop blur
- **Buttons:** Primary (gradient), Secondary (outline with blur), Ghost
- **Cards:** Glass-morphism effect with subtle borders and shadows
- **Forms:** Floating labels, rounded inputs with focus states
- **3D Elements:** CSS transforms for depth, subtle parallax scrolling

### Visual Treatment
**Gradients:** Blue to purple diagonal gradients (240 100% 65% to 260 80% 55%) for hero backgrounds and accent elements

**3D Effects:**
- Floating cards with transform perspective
- Subtle parallax on scroll
- Depth through layered shadows and lighting effects
- Interactive hover states with 3D transforms

### Key Sections (Maximum 4)
1. **Hero Section:** Large 3D floating elements, animated background gradients, powerful headline
2. **Features Section:** Interactive 3D cards showcasing webinar capabilities
3. **Social Proof:** Testimonials with floating avatar arrangements
4. **CTA Section:** Immersive signup form with 3D button treatments

### Images
**Hero Image:** Large abstract 3D rendered background showing floating geometric shapes or holographic elements representing digital connection/webinars

**Section Images:** 
- 3D icons for features (microphone, screen share, analytics)
- Isometric illustrations of webinar setups
- Abstract geometric patterns for section dividers

### Animations
**Minimal but Impactful:**
- Gentle floating animation on 3D elements
- Smooth transitions on hover (transform scale/rotate)
- Subtle entrance animations on scroll
- Gradient color shifts on interactive elements

### Modern Web Principles
- **Hierarchy:** Bold typography contrasts, generous whitespace
- **Balance:** Asymmetrical layouts with 3D elements as focal points
- **Contrast:** Dark backgrounds with bright accent colors and white text
- **Depth:** Multiple z-layers with shadows and transforms creating spatial relationships
